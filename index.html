<h1>Ever since the assembly line was put into use by <abbr title="He did not invent the assembly line but rather revolutionized it">Henry Ford</abbr> in 1903 the automobile has become increasingly popular and much easier to obtain.</h1>
<p>Why is this topic important? On today’s roads 96% of all vehicles driven are powered by an internal combustion engine. There are different designs to this engine type. In automobiles today we have an option for diesel engines and gasoline engines, recently electric propulsion has become more popular.The average citizen needs to learn the importance of the diesel understand and how it can save them time and money, as well as have knowledge of other existing options.
<br>
Diesel Engines are more efficient, they last longer, and they produce less emissions than their gasoline counterparts contrary
to popular belief.</p>

<h2><i>The following lists and explains the possible benefits of owning and operating a diesel powered vehicle.</i></h2>
<p>With increasing regulations and rising prices choosing an economical means of transportation for work commutes and retrieving goods from stores is imperative.
<br> Choosing diesel over gasoline will save you money
</p>

<ol>
  <li>diesel engines are more efficient by design. Gasoline engines have a lower thermal efficiency than diesel engines which means more energy is wasted into useless heat and not contributing to the movement of the vehicle said engine is equipted in gasoline engine as opposed to diesels.</li>
  <li>Diesel engines also create less emissions than gasoline engines contrary to popular belief.</li>
  <li> Diesel engines have double the service life of a gasoline engine which will save you money because you have to service diesels less and replacing the engine is few and far between.</li>

<p>Diesel vs gasoline is often debated upon when it comes to buying a new vehicle or getting a used one in a european car market but often not the case in the United States since the options are not as well known or publicitized. The most commonly purchased diesel vehicle in the United States would be a pickup truck or in the more recent years due to rising <abbr title="Corperate Average Fuel Economy">CAFE</abbr> standards full sized SUVs
<br>
Most Americans check the fuel economy rating of a vehicle before they buy it. Having a fuel-efficient vehicle is important because money not spent in one area can be put to another area such as paying rent ,utilities bills, or just to buy yourself a nice present. Considering a diesel vehicle could be a means to having lowered fuel consumption in your daily driver. Comparing Diesel vs Gasoline is also of importance when it comes to environmental concern which has a major weight because it influences the cost of the vehicle and influences its ability to operate and how it operates on public roads. vehicles with low fuel consumption are incentivised heavily by the federal government. “…in a study they conducted to compare the fuel efficiency of diesel and gas engines, diesel engines were 29 percent more efficient on the highway and 24 percent more efficient in the city.” (Research, Hearst Autos) Diesel engines are able to acomplish this by having a higher thermal efficiency. Thermal efficiency is a measure of how effectively a thermal energy conversion system, such as a heat engine, converts heat input into useful work output. Diesel engines use compression ignition which turns the heat generated from the rapid compression of air into an ignition source for the atomized diesel fuel.</p>
