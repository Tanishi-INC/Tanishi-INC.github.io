<p>Many might argue that diesel engines are hard to start in
cold weather, but this is only the case when it is below freezing temperatures. This becomes the
case when the temperature is below freezing. In the United States the only place that gets cold
enough to make cold starting a diesel hard is Alaska. To prepare an engine for winter (gas or
diesel) it is necessary to put winter blend fuel and winter blend engine oil. In the United States
mainland, the most you will have to do are these two steps. In Alaska, some may find it necessary
to equip the vehicle with engine warmers to make sure the engine stays at a warmer temperature.
And some might find it necessary to mix kerosene with the diesel fuel to preventing the diesel fuel
from turning into a gel like substance similar to bacon grease after it has cooled. In extremely cold
climates even electric vehicles struggle. An electric car would have to stay plugged in all night to
keep the battery at a safe temperature.
<br>
Another argument against diesels is the cost of diesel fuel. On average diesel costs up to 2 dollars
more per gallon than gasoline. This is because of the low sulfur refining that takes place. This is
done in attempt to lower particulate matter in diesel fuel. Even though diesel costs more it is still
cheaper to use. Because of the efficiency of the diesel engine, you still fill up half the amount as
you would with gasoline</p>
