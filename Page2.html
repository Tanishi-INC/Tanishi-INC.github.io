<h1>Longjevity across the board</h1>
<p>Because diesels use compression ignition, they are able to make torque at a lower rpm. Because of 
this lower rpm range, they vibrate less allowing them to last longer than their gasoline 
counterparts.
 “Diesel engines also have fewer components than gas engines, which means your car has fewer 
potential parts that could malfunction. Most diesel engines require fewer repair and maintenance 
services than gas engines, which represents an overall economic saving.” (Research, Hearst Autos) Diesel engines require less sensors to run as opposed to a gas engine. less sensors mean less possible points of failure. Less complexity means more reliability in cars. less complexity also means cars will be cheaper to build. Semi truck engines have a service life of arround 1,000,000 miles that is more than quadruple the lifespan of a typical gas engine in a car or 1/2 ton truck. Most gas engines dont make it past 150,000 miles before needing a major repair. Another contributor to long lifespan is that diesel engines dont need to rev very high to generate lots of tourque, this is also something that makes them more efficient. high revving engines dont last as long as low revving engines.</p>

<h2>Diesel and the enviorment</h2>
<p>Diesels produce less emissions than gasoline engines contrary to popular beliefs. 
“… we can calculate that when compared to its gasoline counterpart the diesel vehicle has 35% lower 
fuel consumption, 53% higher fuel economy, and 27% lower CO2 emissions.” (Sullivan, J. L., et al) 
Despite popular belief diesels are better for the environment than gasoline engines . Most people 
see diesels as soot dumping, noisy and dirty. Diesels only produce black smoke when more fuel is added 
than can be burned into the engine, this is a tuning issue which is sometimes provoked on pourpus. Modern diesel vehicles do not do this because of accurate fuel control by an engine control computer. Modern diesels also have particulate matter filters that 
prevent soot from exiting the exhaust. The use of diesel exhaust fluid also prevents excessive soot 
from entering the atmosphere. Diesel engines not only produce less carbon dioxide but less carbon 
monoxide aswell. Diesel fuel does not evaporate which means it cannot release hydrocarbons into the 
atmosphere which creates ground level ozone. Ground level ozone (or smog) causes many 
respiratory problems such as increasing chances for asthma</p>
